# What is PRISM?

PRISM stands for **Psychological Research Information System Model** — a data and
metadata model for psychological research datasets. PRISM extends
[BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) for workflows common in psychology
(questionnaires, biometrics, environment descriptions, richer study metadata) while
keeping compatibility with the standard BIDS ecosystem. **PRISM Studio** is the
software that implements these workflows as a web interface and command-line tools.

```{important}
PRISM does not replace BIDS. It adds structure for psychological research while
preserving the ability to use BIDS-oriented tooling.
```

**Why PRISM exists**: psychological studies need data structures only partially
covered by standard BIDS practice — survey instruments with item-level descriptions
and response options, sociodemographics/participant harmonization, biometrics and
performance-testing metadata, physiology/environment metadata tied to a study
workflow, and recipe-based scoring with reproducible derived outputs. PRISM gives
those areas a documented structure instead of leaving them as spreadsheet
conventions or lab-specific folder rules.

## How PRISM relates to BIDS

| Topic | BIDS | PRISM |
|---|---|---|
| Primary baseline | Dataset organization for established BIDS modalities | Adds psychology-focused structure and metadata |
| Surveys | Limited practical support | Rich sidecars, items, response options, and scoring support |
| Biometrics and performance tests | Not a standard focus | Dedicated schema support |
| Environment metadata | Not consistently standardized in practice | Structured sidecars and workflows |
| Validation | BIDS rules | PRISM rules with optional BIDS validation alongside them |
| Scoring and exports | Not part of BIDS itself | Implemented in PRISM Studio workflows |

In practice, BIDS compatibility means: your dataset still follows BIDS naming where
BIDS applies; PRISM-specific files are kept explicit instead of hidden in ad-hoc
spreadsheets; PRISM validation can run alongside BIDS validation; downstream BIDS
apps can still operate on the parts of the dataset they expect.

## What PRISM Studio adds

PRISM Studio turns the model into day-to-day workflows: **guided project setup**
(create/open a project, manage study metadata, track project-local templates,
prepare export-ready datasets); **conversion** (Excel/CSV/SPSS/LimeSurvey exports →
structured PRISM/BIDS outputs); **validation** (severity levels, error codes,
optional BIDS checks, selected auto-fix support); **templates and metadata** (build
survey/biometrics templates, edit JSON sidecars safely); **scoring and exports**
(recipes, derived values, CSV/SPSS/shareable bundles).

## Supported modalities

| Modality | Typical files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Survey | `.tsv` plus `.json` | Questionnaires, assessments, item metadata, response options |
| Biometrics | `.tsv` plus `.json` | Performance and testing workflows |
| Physiological | `.edf`, `.edf+`, or tabular signals plus `.json` | Continuous signals with metadata |
| Eyetracking | `.tsv` plus `.json` | BIDS passthrough — no PRISM-specific content processing |
| Environment | `.tsv` plus `.json` | Environmental or contextual metadata |
| Events | `.tsv` plus `.json` | Task and stimulus timing or event logs |
| Standard BIDS imaging and EEG modalities | Standard BIDS files | Validated under BIDS expectations where applicable |

See [Specifications](SPECIFICATIONS.md) and the pages under `docs/specs/` for the
detailed schema layer.

## Project vs. dataset

A **project** is the whole working area: study metadata, `code/`, `derivatives/`,
`sourcedata/`, local library assets, and the dataset itself. A **dataset** is the
data structure you validate and ultimately share.

        └── sub-001_task-demo_survey.json
```

`participants.tsv`/`participants.json` aren't part of this "at creation" tree — they're
written once you run the participants import step. PRISM encourages a YODA-style
layout, keeping incoming source material, validated data, code, and derived outputs
separate.

DataLad is optional but useful for larger projects: large-file handling with
provenance, portable project history, reproducible export/mutation workflows,
project structures that scale beyond small local folders. See [DataLad](DATALAD.md).

## Example: self-documenting survey data

```json
{
  "SurveyName": "Wellbeing Demo",
  "Items": [
    {
      "ItemID": "WB01",
      "Question": { "en": "I felt motivated to start my daily tasks" },
      "ResponseOptions": {
        "0": "At no time",
        "1": "Some of the time",
        "2": "Most of the time",
        "3": "All of the time"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

That makes the data easier to understand, validate, reuse, and export.
