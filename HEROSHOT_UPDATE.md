# ⚠️ Heroshot Screenshot System - Updated Documentation

## What Changed

I discovered that **Heroshot v0.13+ completely changed** from a config-file-based tool to an **interactive visual editor**. This means:

- ❌ You cannot manually write `.heroshot/config.json`
- ❌ The capture scripts I created won't work
- ✅ You must use Heroshot's browser-based visual editor
- ✅ Config files are auto-generated from visual configuration

## How Heroshot v0.13+ Actually Works

### Interactive Workflow

1. Start PRISM Studio:
   ```bash
   python prism-studio.py
   ```

2. Launch Heroshot visual editor:
   ```bash
   cd .heroshot
   npx heroshot
   ```

3. Browser opens with Heroshot UI where you:
   - Navigate to pages (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5001/converter)
   - **Click elements** to select what to screenshot
   - Add styling, borders, annotations visually
   - Save screenshot definitions

4. Screenshots automatically save to `heroshots/` directory

5. Config saves to `.heroshot/config.json` (auto-generated)

### After Initial Setup

Once configured, regenerate all screenshots with:
```bash
cd .heroshot
npx heroshot  # Runs headlessly, uses saved config
```

## Files Updated

All documentation has been updated to reflect the interactive workflow:

### `.heroshot/` Directory

- ✅ **config.json** - Reset to empty (will be auto-generated by Heroshot)
- ✅ **HEROSHOT_SETUP.md** - Updated with interactive workflow instructions
- ✅ **README.md** - Updated quick start guide
- ✅ **capture-workshop-screenshots.sh** - Replaced with deprecation notice
- ⚠️ **capture-workshop-screenshots.bat** - Still has old code (Windows only)
- 📁 **capture-workshop-screenshots-OLD.sh** - Original script (backup)

### Documentation  Files

- ✅ **docs/workshop/SCREENSHOTS_QUICK_START.md** - Updated with interactive steps
- ✅ **examples/workshop/README.md** - Updated screenshot section
- ✅ **HEROSHOT_SCREENSHOTS.md** - Updated summary

## Next Steps for Users

### Option 1: Use Heroshot (Recommended)

Follow the interactive workflow above to configure and capture screenshots.

**Pros:**
- Official tool workflow
- Visual configuration (no coding)
- Supports annotations, styling
- Auto-updates config

**Cons:**
- Requires manual initial setup (point-and-click each interface)
- Takes 10-15 minutes for first-time configuration

### Option 2: Manual Screenshots (Alternative)

If Heroshot's interactive workflow doesn't fit your needs:

1. Open PRISM Studio manually
2. Navigate to each interface
3. Take screenshots with OS screenshot tool
4. Save to desired location
5. Commit to repo

**Pros:**
- Simple, no tool dependency
- Full control over framing

**Cons:**
- Manual process every time
- No automation
- Harder to keep consistent

### Option 3: Different Screenshot Tool

Consider alternatives like:
- **Playwright/Puppeteer** - Code-based automation
- **Selenium** - Browser automation with scripts
- **Shot-scraper** - CLI screenshot tool with URL lists

## What I Learned

Heroshot evolved significantly between versions:
- **v0.12 and below**: Config-file based (JSON)
- **v0.13+**: Interactive visual editor (point-and-click)

The npm documentation shows the current approach (v0.15.0 latest) uses:
- Visual element selection
- In-browser configuration
- Auto-generated config files
- One-command regeneration after setup

## Running the Deprecation Notice

If a user tries the old script:

```bash
./.heroshot/capture-workshop-screenshots.sh
```

They see:
```
⚠️  DEPRECATED SCRIPT

This script was created for an older version of Heroshot that used JSON config files.
Heroshot v0.13+ uses an INTERACTIVE VISUAL EDITOR instead.

📚 How to Use Heroshot v0.13+:

1. Start PRISM Studio:
   python prism-studio.py

2. Launch Heroshot visual editor:
   cd .heroshot
   npx heroshot

3. Configure screenshots interactively in the browser that opens

4. After configuration, run `npx heroshot` to regenerate

📖 See .heroshot/HEROSHOT_SETUP.md for complete instructions
```

## Summary

The workshop documentation is now accurate for Heroshot v0.13+. Users will:
1. Use the interactive visual editor for first-time setup
2. Click and configure screenshots in a browser
3. Run `npx heroshot` to regenerate after updates
4. Find clear instructions in all documentation files

The old automated scripts have been deprecated with clear upgrade guidance.
