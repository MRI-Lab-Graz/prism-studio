GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2026 PRISM contributors

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
 free software for all its users.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in
 new free programs, and that you are protected from having to give up
 these rights by someone else's patents.

 The Affero GPL specifically augments the ordinary GPL to ensure that
 users who interact with the program remotely through a computer network
 have the opportunity to receive the source for that program.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

 "You" means an individual or legal entity exercising rights under this
 License.  Your "contributor" is any person or entity that distributes or
 makes the Program available to you.

 "Modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the Program in a
 fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
 copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the Program.

 "Relevant Source" for a work in object code form means the preferred form of
 the work for making modifications to it.  For a standard executable, that
 means the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
 installation of the executable.

 "Network Use" means the operation of the Program to provide services over a
 network, where users interact with the Program through network requests.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  Where the work is a work that normally is
 distributed in compiled form, the source code means the source for all the
 modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
 scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
 the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

 3. Protecting Users' Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
 under any applicable law that restricts circumvention of such measures.

 4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
 from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 5.

 5. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 When you convey a covered work in object code form, you must also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License.

 6. Additional Terms.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you may add additional
 permissions to a covered work, provided they are compatible with the terms of
 this License.

 7. Termination.

 If you violate this License, your rights under this License are terminated.

 8. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
 copy of the Program.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
 or propagate the Program.

 9. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
 license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work
 subject to the terms of this License.

 10. Future Revisions of this License.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
 Affero GPL from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit
 to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
 concerns.
