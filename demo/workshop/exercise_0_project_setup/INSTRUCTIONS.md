## Launching PRISM

### Windows Users

2. Double-click to launch it.
3. A terminal window will open—keep this open! It runs the backend server.
4. Your default web browser should open automatically to **http://localhost:5001**.

2. Go to: **http://localhost:5001**

## Your Task: Create a Project

Before we can convert or validate data, we need a "Project" where everything will be stored.

### Step 1: Go to Projects
1. In the sidebar or top navigation, click on **"Projects"**.
2. Alternatively, go directly to: **http://localhost:5001/projects**

### Step 2: Initialize a New Project
1. Look for the **"Create New Project"** section.
2. **Project Name:** Enter `My_Psychology_Study`.
3. **Location:** Choose a folder on your computer where you want to store your data (e.g., your Desktop or a dedicated `workshop_results` folder).
4. Click **"Create & Activate"**.

### Step 3: Verify Your Workspace
1. Notice the **"Active Project"** label at the top of the screen. It should now show `My_Psychology_Study`.
2. PRISM now knows where to save all your conversions and exports!
